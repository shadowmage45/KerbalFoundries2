	description = Optimised for Kerbin straight out of its wooden crate - though tweakable for higher gravity - this wheel is designed for large, high-mobility planetary rovers. Criticised for being power-hungry, but never for being over powered! (Warning: Extremely over powered. Warranty void when used under the influence of gravity.)
